# Crash-Roulette
Care to try it?
Russian roulette, defined as an activity that is potentially VERY dangerous.
Well the traditional Russian roulette focuses on physical damage, we focus on melting you from within giving you the ultimate psychological torment.
Introducing you to Crash Roulette. 
Crash roulette mixes the intensity of Russian roulette and crashing your computer adds the consequences. 
We wanted to put something on the line so you can feel somethings on the line. We'd like to show you a harmless example, it will create a dummy file and if you were to lose the game it will delete the file. But a more deadly version is when you put your System32 file on line.......care to try it?
With the theme song of the "Godfather" playing in the background, it truly emulates an environment fit for a deadly game of Russian Roulette, or in our case, the Crash Roulette.

We created different versions so that if you want to test you could go for the easier version but if want the intensity you want to risk it all you could go for the harder version.

We have 2 parts to it, the first is arduino to which we have connected buzzers, leds and a switch. It just serves a trigger for the roulette. When clicked, the trigger communicates to the python code which then plays out the crash roulette's main logic code.
We have uploaded 2 different files for the python code, one is the safe version, but if you would like to up the stakes you can add the lines of code from the next file which can truly make your System32 vanish.
